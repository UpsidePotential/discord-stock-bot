Why don't people get that EDM is a genre of electronic music, danceable beats, and synthesized soundscapes.
EDM describes a broad spectrum of electronic music styles, including house, techno, trance, dubstep, and more.
Pioneering artists like Kraftwerk, Daft Punk, and The Chemical Brothers played crucial roles in shaping the foundation of EDM.
I love festivals like Tomorrowland, Ultra Music Festival, and Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC).
Don't judge me. EDM is one of the most influential and widespread music genres of the 21st century.
