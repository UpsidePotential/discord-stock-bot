Euler-Bernoulli Beam Equation: Describes the behavior of a beam under bending. It states that the curvature of a beam is proportional to the bending moment acting on it.
Hooke's Law: Defines the relationship between stress and strain in elastic materials. It states that the strain is directly proportional to the stress within the proportional limit.
Pascal's Principle: States that pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid in all directions. It's essential in hydraulic engineering and fluid mechanics.
Archimedes' Principle: Describes the buoyant force experienced by a body immersed in a fluid. It states that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body.
Coulomb's Law of Friction: Governs the frictional force between two surfaces in contact. It states that the frictional force is proportional to the normal force and is independent of the contact area.
Newmark's Method: A numerical technique used in structural engineering to solve differential equations of motion for structures subjected to dynamic loads, such as earthquakes.
Terzaghi's Principle: Concerns the effective stress in soil mechanics. It states that the total stress in a soil mass is the sum of the effective stress and the pore water pressure.
Rankine's Theory of Earth Pressure: Describes the lateral pressure exerted by soil on retaining walls. It provides equations to calculate active and passive earth pressures.
Truss Analysis Equations: Various methods such as the method of joints and method of sections are used to analyze truss structures, determining member forces and reactions.
Moment Distribution Method: A structural analysis technique used to solve indeterminate structures by distributing moments throughout the structure.
Cantilever Retaining Wall Equations: Used in geotechnical engineering to design retaining walls that support soil or other materials on one side.
