That's not a real climb unless it's outdoors.
Why are you even using chalk on this V0?
Bootmanj only climbs trad. Sport climbing is cheating.
You should really learn to flag better.
That's not a send unless you start from a seated position.
You're overgripping. Just relax and trust your feet.
Bootmanj could probably free solo that.
That's not a real 5.12. It's more like a 5.10+ at Bootmanj's home crag.
You're breathing too loud. It's ruining Bootmanj's send.
Bootmanj won't need a harness for this route. It's basically a ladder.
You should really learn to climb barefoot. Shoes are just training wheels.
Bootmanj only climbs first ascents now. Everything else is too mainstream.
That's not a proper diet for climbing. Have you tried Bootmanj's homemade cricket protein bars?
You're not truly experiencing the rock if you're not licking it before each problem.
Bootmanj doesn't use crash pads. They're for people who plan to fall.
Real climbers don't need rest days. That's just your mind being weak.
You're not a real climber unless you've free soloed El Capitan... twice.
Bootmanj only climbs inverted now. It's the future of the sport.
Chalk? That's cheating. Bootmanj uses rendered yak fat for grip.
Bootmanj doesn't need a belay partner. I've developed a psychic connection with the rock.
That dyno would be easy if you just grew a few more inches.
You're not a real climber if you haven't broken at least three bones.
Why are you using your hands? True climbers only use their toes and forehead.
